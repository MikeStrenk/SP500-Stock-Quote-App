# Stock Analysis App
This single page webapp displays analysis for the best and worst stocks from the previous trading day. Additionally sectors are ranked by performance. This app is powered by a python script that scrapes the stock quote information for each S&amp;P 500 stock ticker each day after closing. That data is then saved into a database used to display on the app's webpage.
